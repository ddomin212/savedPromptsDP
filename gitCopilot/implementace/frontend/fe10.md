do you have any tips for refactoring this react component?

Without seeing the rest of the codebase, it's difficult to suggest specific refactorings. However, here are some general tips for refactoring React components:

1. Break up large components into smaller ones: If a component is doing too much, consider breaking it up into smaller, more focused components. This can make the code easier to understand and maintain.

2. Use props to pass data down: Instead of relying on state to pass data between components, use props to pass data down from parent components to child components. This can make the code more predictable and easier to reason about.

3. Use state sparingly: State can be useful for managing component-specific data, but it can also make the code more complex. Try to use state sparingly and only when necessary.

4. Use functional components: If a component doesn't need to manage state or lifecycle methods, consider using a functional component instead of a class component. Functional components are often simpler and easier to read.

5. Use hooks: If you need to manage state or lifecycle methods in a functional component, use hooks like useState and useEffect. Hooks can make it easier to manage state and lifecycle methods in functional components.

6. Use CSS-in-JS libraries: If you're using inline styles, consider using a CSS-in-JS library like styled-components or emotion. These libraries can make it easier to write and manage styles in React components.

I hope these tips help! Let me know if you have any specific questions or concerns.
