ddomin212: how can i assert there are N number of elements with some "data-testid" property on page in cypress?

GitHub Copilot: You can use the `cy.get()` command with a CSS selector that matches the elements with the `data-testid` property, and then use the `.should()` command with the `have.length` assertion to check the number of elements. Here's an example:

```javascript
cy.get('[data-testid="some-test-id"]').should('have.length', N);
```

Replace `some-test-id` with the value of the `data-testid` property you want to match, and replace `N` with the expected number of elements.



ddomin212: how can i print the page contents in cypress

GitHub Copilot: You can use the `cy.document()` command to get the `document` object of the page, and then use the `document.documentElement.outerHTML` property to get the HTML contents of the page. Here's an example:

```javascript
cy.document().then((doc) => {
  const html = doc.documentElement.outerHTML;
  console.log(html);
});
```

This will log the HTML contents of the page to the console. You can also use the `cy.log()` command to log the contents to the Cypress command log:

```javascript
cy.document().then((doc) => {
  const html = doc.documentElement.outerHTML;
  cy.log(html);
});
```



ddomin212: assert that the elemet with toastify is not empty

GitHub Copilot: You can use the `.should()` command with the `not.be.empty` assertion to check that the element with the `Toastify` class is not empty. Here's an example:

```javascript
cy.get('[class="Toastify"]').should('not.be.empty');
```

This will assert that the element with the `Toastify` class is not empty.



ddomin212: assert that somewhere inside the innerText of the element with class toastify lies the text "Error"

GitHub Copilot: You can use the `.should()` command with the `include` assertion to check that the text "Error" is included in the `innerText` of the element with the `Toastify` class. Here's an example:

```javascript
cy.get('[class="Toastify"]').should('include', 'Error');
```

This will assert that the text "Error" is included in the `innerText` of the element with the `Toastify` class.



ddomin212: what if the text is nested under multiple other tags

GitHub Copilot: You can use the `.contains()` command to search for an element that contains the text "Error", and then use the `.should()` command with the `exist` assertion to check that the element exists. Here's an example:

```javascript
cy.contains('[class="Toastify"]', 'Error').should('exist');
```

This will search for an element with the `Toastify` class that contains the text "Error", and then assert that the element exists.



ddomin212: how can i test google popup authentication with cypress?


GitHub Copilot: To test Google popup authentication with Cypress, you can use the `cy.window()` command to interact with the popup window and the `cy.stub()` command to stub the `window.open()` method. Here's an example:

```javascript
describe('Google popup authentication', () => {
  it('logs in successfully', () => {
    cy.visit('http://localhost:3000');
    cy.stub(window, 'open').as('windowOpen');
    cy.get('[data-testid="sign-in-button"]').click();
    cy.get('@windowOpen').should('be.called');
    cy.window().then((win) => {
      const { location } = win;
      expect(location.href).to.include('https://accounts.google.com');
      // interact with the popup window here
    });
  });
});
```

This test stubs the `window.open()` method and clicks on the sign-in button to trigger the popup window. It then checks that the `window.open()` method was called and that the URL of the popup window includes `https://accounts.google.com`. You can then interact with the popup window using the `cy.window()` command.

Note that you will need to provide valid Google authentication credentials to test this functionality.



ddomin212: can i set a react state variable inside cypress?

GitHub Copilot: Yes, you can set a React state variable inside Cypress by using the `cy.window()` command to access the `window` object and then calling the `setState()` method on the React component. Here's an example:

```javascript
cy.window().then((win) => {
  const component = win.document.querySelector('#my-component');
  component.setState({ myStateVariable: 'new value' });
});
```

Replace `my-component` with the ID of the React component you want to modify, and replace `myStateVariable` with the name of the state variable you want to modify.

Note that this approach assumes that the React component is mounted and rendered in the DOM. If the component is not mounted, you may need to use a different approach to set the state variable.



ddomin212: i am getting an undefined error on my firebase.initializeApp

GitHub Copilot: Make sure that you have correctly imported your Firebase configuration object from `firebaseConfig.js` and that it contains the necessary configuration values for your Firebase project. 

Also, make sure that you have installed the Firebase SDK and imported the necessary Firebase modules at the top of your file:

```javascript
import firebase from "firebase/app";
import "firebase/auth";
import "firebase/database";
import "firebase/firestore";
```

If you are still getting an undefined error, try logging the `firebaseConfig` object to the console to make sure it is being imported correctly:

```javascript
import firebase from "firebase/app";
import "firebase/auth";
import "firebase/database";
import "firebase/firestore";
import firebaseConfig from "../../src/services/firebaseConfig";

console.log(firebaseConfig);

firebase.initializeApp(firebaseConfig);
```

This will log the `firebaseConfig` object to the console so you can verify that it contains the correct configuration values.



ddomin212: cypress-firebase does not recognize my serviceAccount.json?

GitHub Copilot: Make sure that your `serviceAccount.json` file is located in the `cypress` folder of your project. 

Also, make sure that the `serviceAccount.json` file contains the correct configuration values for your Firebase project. You can verify this by logging the contents of the `serviceAccount.json` file to the console:

```javascript
const serviceAccount = require('../../cypress/serviceAccount.json');
console.log(serviceAccount);
```

This will log the contents of the `serviceAccount.json` file to the console so you can verify that it contains the correct configuration values.

Finally, make sure that you have correctly configured the `cypress-firebase` plugin in your `cypress/plugins/index.js` file:

```javascript
const admin = require('firebase-admin');
const cypressFirebasePlugin = require('cypress-firebase').plugin;

module.exports = (on, config) => {
  const extendedConfig = cypressFirebasePlugin(on, config, admin);
  return extendedConfig;
};
```

This will configure the `cypress-firebase` plugin to use the `firebase-admin` module and pass it to your Cypress tests.



ddomin212: intialize firebase app with credentials

GitHub Copilot: To initialize a Firebase app with credentials, you need to create a `firebaseConfig` object that contains your Firebase project's configuration values. You can find these values in the Firebase console under Project settings > General > Your apps > Firebase SDK snippet.

Here's an example `firebaseConfig` object:

```javascript
const firebaseConfig = {
  apiKey: "YOUR_API_KEY",
  authDomain: "YOUR_AUTH_DOMAIN",
  databaseURL: "YOUR_DATABASE_URL",
  projectId: "YOUR_PROJECT_ID",
  storageBucket: "YOUR_STORAGE_BUCKET",
  messagingSenderId: "YOUR_MESSAGING_SENDER_ID",
  appId: "YOUR_APP_ID",
  measurementId: "YOUR_MEASUREMENT_ID"
};

firebase.initializeApp(firebaseConfig);
```

Replace the `YOUR_` placeholders with the corresponding values from your Firebase project's configuration.

Note that you will also need to import the Firebase SDK and the necessary Firebase modules at the top of your file:

```javascript
import firebase from "firebase/app";
import "firebase/auth";
import "firebase/database";
import "firebase/firestore";
```



ddomin212: can i add service credentials to it?

GitHub Copilot: Yes, you can add service credentials to your Firebase app by passing a `serviceAccount` object to the `firebase.initializeApp()` method. Here's an example:

```javascript
const serviceAccount = require('./serviceAccount.json');

const firebaseConfig = {
  apiKey: "YOUR_API_KEY",
  authDomain: "YOUR_AUTH_DOMAIN",
  databaseURL: "YOUR_DATABASE_URL",
  projectId: "YOUR_PROJECT_ID",
  storageBucket: "YOUR_STORAGE_BUCKET",
  messagingSenderId: "YOUR_MESSAGING_SENDER_ID",
  appId: "YOUR_APP_ID",
  measurementId: "YOUR_MEASUREMENT_ID",
  credential: admin.credential.cert(serviceAccount)
};

firebase.initializeApp(firebaseConfig);
```

Replace the `YOUR_` placeholders with the corresponding values from your Firebase project's configuration, and make sure that the `serviceAccount.json` file is located in the same directory as your `firebaseConfig.js` file.

Note that you will also need to import the Firebase SDK and the necessary Firebase modules at the top of your file:

```javascript
import firebase from "firebase/app";
import "firebase/auth";
import "firebase/database";
import "firebase/firestore";
```



ddomin212: Failed to determine service account. Make sure to initialize the SDK with a service account credential. Alternatively specify a service account with iam.serviceAccounts.signBlob permission. Original error: Error: Error while making request: getaddrinfo EAI_AGAIN metadata. Error code: EAI_AGAIN

GitHub Copilot: The error message suggests that the Firebase SDK is unable to determine the service account credentials. This can happen if the `serviceAccount.json` file is not located in the correct directory or if the file contains invalid or incomplete credentials.

To fix this issue, make sure that the `serviceAccount.json` file is located in the `cypress` folder of your project and that it contains the correct credentials for your Firebase project. You can verify this by logging the contents of the `serviceAccount.json` file to the console:

```javascript
const serviceAccount = require('../../cypress/serviceAccount.json');
console.log(serviceAccount);
```

This will log the contents of the `serviceAccount.json` file to the console so you can verify that it contains the correct credentials.

If the `serviceAccount.json` file is located in the correct directory and contains the correct credentials, try specifying the `serviceAccount` option when initializing the Firebase app:

```javascript
const firebaseConfig = {
  // your Firebase config here
  serviceAccount: require('../../cypress/serviceAccount.json'),
};

firebase.initializeApp(firebaseConfig);
```

This will explicitly specify the service account credentials when initializing the Firebase app.



ddomin212: change App component React state variable in cypress

GitHub Copilot: To change a React state variable in Cypress, you can use the `cy.window()` command to access the `window` object and then call the `setState()` method on the React component. Here's an example:

```javascript
cy.window().then((win) => {
  const component = win.document.querySelector('#my-component');
  component.setState({ myStateVariable: 'new value' });
});
```

Replace `my-component` with the ID of the React component you want to modify, and replace `myStateVariable` with the name of the state variable you want to modify.

If you want to modify the state of the `App` component, you can use the `cy.get()` command to get the root element of the `App` component and then call the `setState()` method on the component:

```javascript
cy.get('#root').then(([root]) => {
  const app = root._reactRootContainer._internalRoot.current.child;
  app.setState({ myStateVariable: 'new value' });
});
```

This will get the root element of the `App` component, extract the `App` component instance from the internal React tree, and then call the `setState()` method on the component.

Note that this approach assumes that the `App` component is mounted and rendered in the DOM. If the component is not mounted, you may need to use a different approach to set the state variable.



ddomin212: so if the state variable inside react is named userData, i should set the userData variable in the object?

GitHub Copilot: Yes, that's correct. If the state variable inside your React component is named `userData`, you can set its value by passing an object with the `userData` property to the `setState()` method. Here's an example:

```javascript
cy.window().then((win) => {
  const component = win.document.querySelector('#my-component');
  component.setState({ userData: { name: 'John', age: 30 } });
});
```

This will set the `userData` state variable to an object with the `name` and `age` properties.

If you want to modify the `userData` state variable of the `App` component, you can use the following code:

```javascript
cy.get('#root').then(([root]) => {
  const app = root._reactRootContainer._internalRoot.current.child;
  app.setState({ userData: { name: 'John', age: 30 } });
});
```

This will set the `userData` state variable of the `App` component to an object with the `name` and `age` properties.



ddomin212: can i call the auth library inside cypress test to authorize myslef with firebase

GitHub Copilot: Yes, you can use the Firebase Authentication library inside a Cypress test to authenticate yourself with Firebase. Here's an example:

```javascript
import firebase from "firebase/app";
import "firebase/auth";

describe("Firebase Authentication", () => {
  it("authenticates the user", () => {
    cy.visit("http://localhost:3000");
    cy.get("#root").then(([root]) => {
      const app = root._reactRootContainer._internalRoot.current.child;
      app.setState({ userData: { username: "John", tier: "paid" } });
    });

    const email = "test@example.com";
    const password = "password123";

    cy.wrap(firebase.auth().createUserWithEmailAndPassword(email, password)).then((userCredential) => {
      const user = userCredential.user;
      expect(user.email).to.equal(email);
    });
  });
});
```

This test authenticates a user with Firebase by calling the `createUserWithEmailAndPassword()` method on the Firebase Authentication library. The `email` and `password` variables contain the user's email address and password, respectively.

Note that you will need to import the Firebase SDK and the necessary Firebase modules at the top of your file:

```javascript
import firebase from "firebase/app";
import "firebase/auth";
import "firebase/database";
import "firebase/firestore";
```



ddomin212: how can i get current url in react

GitHub Copilot: You can get the current URL in a React component by accessing the `window.location.href` property. Here's an example:

```javascript
import React from "react";

function MyComponent() {
  const currentUrl = window.location.href;

  return (
    <div>
      <p>The current URL is: {currentUrl}</p>
    </div>
  );
}

export default MyComponent;
```

This will display the current URL in the `MyComponent` component.

Note that `window.location.href` returns the full URL, including the protocol, domain, path, and query parameters. If you only need to get the path or query parameters, you can use `window.location.pathname` or `window.location.search`, respectively.



ddomin212: How can I get the current URL in Cypress?

GitHub Copilot: You can get the current URL in Cypress by using the `cy.url()` command. Here's an example:

```javascript
cy.url().then((url) => {
  console.log(url);
});
```

This will log the current URL to the console.

If you want to assert that the current URL matches a certain pattern, you can use the `cy.url()` command with the `should()` command:

```javascript
cy.url().should("match", /\/my-page$/);
```

This will assert that the current URL ends with `/my-page`.



ddomin212: how can i execute a piece of cypress code only when a certain element is located on the page?

GitHub Copilot: You can use the `cy.get()` command with the `should()` command to wait for an element to exist on the page before executing a piece of Cypress code. Here's an example:

```javascript
cy.get('[data-testid="my-element"]').should("exist").then(() => {
  // execute your Cypress code here
});
```

This will wait for an element with the `data-testid` attribute set to `my-element` to exist on the page before executing the code inside the `then()` callback.

If you want to execute a different piece of Cypress code if the element does not exist on the page, you can use the `cy.get()` command with the `should()` and `else()` commands:

```javascript
cy.get('[data-testid="my-element"]')
  .should("exist")
  .then(() => {
    // execute your Cypress code here
  })
  .else(() => {
    // execute a different piece of Cypress code here
  });
```

This will execute the code inside the first `then()` callback if the element exists on the page, and the code inside the `else()` callback if the element does not exist on the page.



ddomin212: assert that the url has stripe in it in cypress

GitHub Copilot: To assert that the URL contains the word "stripe" in Cypress, you can use the `cy.url()` command with the `should()` command and a regular expression. Here's an example:

```javascript
cy.url().should("match", /stripe/);
```

This will assert that the current URL contains the word "stripe".

If you want to assert that the URL contains a specific string, you can replace `/stripe/` with the string you want to match. For example:

```javascript
cy.url().should("include", "stripe.com");
```

This will assert that the current URL includes the string "stripe.com".



ddomin212: only click the button if you can find it in cypress

GitHub Copilot: To only click the "Sign Out" button if it exists on the page, you can use the `cy.get()` command with the `should()` command to wait for the button to exist before clicking it. Here's an example:

```javascript
cy.get('[data-testid="sign-out-button"]')
  .should("exist")
  .then(() => {
    cy.get('[data-testid="sign-out-button"]').click();
  });
```

This will wait for the "Sign Out" button to exist on the page before clicking it.

If the button does not exist on the page, the `should()` command will fail and the code inside the `then()` callback will not be executed.



ddomin212: this tries to click the button even when it is not there

GitHub Copilot: You can use the `cy.get()` command with the `should()` command to wait for the "Sign Out" button to exist on the page before clicking it. Here's an updated example:

```javascript
cy.get('[data-testid="sign-out-button"]')
  .should("exist")
  .then(() => {
    cy.get('[data-testid="sign-out-button"]').click();
  });
```

This will wait for the "Sign Out" button to exist on the page before clicking it. If the button does not exist on the page, the `should()` command will fail and the code inside the `then()` callback will not be executed.



ddomin212: what if i want to continue if the element is not found

GitHub Copilot: If you want to continue with the test even if the "Sign Out" button is not found, you can use the `cy.get()` command with the `should()` and `then()` commands to execute a callback function if the button is found, and a different callback function if the button is not found. Here's an example:

```javascript
cy.get('[data-testid="sign-out-button"]')
  .should("exist")
  .then(() => {
    cy.get('[data-testid="sign-out-button"]').click();
  })
  .catch(() => {
    // do something else if the button is not found
  });
```

This will click the "Sign Out" button if it exists on the page, and execute the code inside the `catch()` callback if the button is not found.

Note that the `catch()` callback will be executed if the `should()` command fails, which can happen if the button is not found on the page.



ddomin212: how can i use the urlParser library to get query parameters from a url

GitHub Copilot: To use the `url-parse` library to get query parameters from a URL in your React component, you can install the library using npm or yarn:

```bash
npm install url-parse
```

or

```bash
yarn add url-parse
```

Then, you can import the library and use it to parse the current URL and extract the query parameters. Here's an example:

```javascript
import React, { useEffect, useState } from "react";
import { useLocation } from "react-router-dom";
import { ToastContainer, toast } from "react-toastify";
import "react-toastify/dist/ReactToastify.css";
import { buyPremium } from "./services/accountService";
import AirQuality from "./components/AirQuality";
import { refreshUserToken, signInUser } from "./services/authService";
import { auth } from "./services/firebaseService";
import { signInWithEmailAndPassword } from "firebase/auth";
import urlParse from "url-parse";

/**
 * The main component of the weather app.
 * @returns {JSX.Element} - The main component of the weather app.
 */
function App() {
  const [query, setQuery] = useState(null);
  const [units, setUnits] = useState("metric");
  const [weather, setWeather] = useState(null);
  const [userData, setUserData] = useState({ tier: "" });
  const location = useLocation();
  const currentUrl = window.location.href;
  const parsedUrl = urlParse(currentUrl, true);

  const bypassLogin = () => {
    if (parsedUrl.query.bypassLogin) {
      signInWithEmailAndPassword(auth, "test@example.com", "123456").then(
        (result) => signInUser({ result, setUserData })
      );
    }
  };

  useEffect(() => {
    if (parsedUrl.query.bypassLogin) {
      bypassLogin();
    } else {
      refreshUserToken({ setUserData }, () => {});
    }
  }, []);

  // rest of the component code
}
```

In this example, we import the `url-parse` library and use it to parse the current URL and extract the query parameters. We then check if the `bypassLogin` query parameter is present in the URL, and call the `bypassLogin()` function if it is.

Note that we also use the `useLocation()` hook from `react-router-dom` to get the current location object, but we don't use it in this example.



ddomin212: how can i expect a redirect to a page that contains "stripe" in its url

GitHub Copilot: To expect a redirect to a page that contains "stripe" in its URL, you can use the `cy.url()` command with the `should()` command and a regular expression. Here's an example:

```javascript
cy.url().should("match", /stripe/);
```

This will assert that the current URL contains the word "stripe".

If you want to assert that the URL contains a specific string, you can replace `/stripe/` with the string you want to match. For example:

```javascript
cy.url().should("include", "stripe.com");
```

This will assert that the current URL includes the string "stripe.com".

If you want to wait for the page to fully load before asserting the URL, you can use the `cy.location()` command with the `should()` command instead:

```javascript
cy.location().should((location) => {
  expect(location.href).to.match(/stripe/);
});
```

This will wait for the page to fully load and then assert that the URL contains the word "stripe".



ddomin212: how can i wait for a certain number of time before asserting

GitHub Copilot: You can use the `cy.wait()` command to wait for a certain amount of time before asserting. Here's an example:

```javascript
cy.get('[data-testid="premium-button"]').click();
cy.wait(5000); // wait for 5 seconds
cy.url().should("include", "stripe");
```

This will wait for 5 seconds before asserting that the URL contains the word "stripe".

Note that the argument to `cy.wait()` is the number of milliseconds to wait. In this example, we're waiting for 5000 milliseconds, or 5 seconds.



ddomin212: how can i test redirects in cypress

GitHub Copilot: To test redirects in Cypress, you can use the `cy.location()` command with the `should()` command to assert that the URL has changed after clicking a link or button. Here's an example:

```javascript
cy.get('[data-testid="my-link"]').click();
cy.location().should((location) => {
  expect(location.href).to.include("/my-page");
});
```

This will click the link with the `data-testid` attribute set to `my-link`, and then assert that the URL includes the string "/my-page".

If you want to wait for a specific amount of time before asserting the URL, you can use the `cy.wait()` command before the `cy.location()` command:

```javascript
cy.get('[data-testid="my-link"]').click();
cy.wait(5000); // wait for 5 seconds
cy.location().should((location) => {
  expect(location.href).to.include("/my-page");
});
```

This will wait for 5 seconds before asserting the URL.

Note that the `cy.location()` command will automatically wait for the page to fully load before asserting the URL.



ddomin212: how can i get a value inside of an element in cypress?

GitHub Copilot: To get the value inside an element in Cypress, you can use the `.invoke()` command with the `text()` function. Here's an example:

```javascript
cy.get('[data-testid="my-element"]').invoke("text").then((text) => {
  // use the text value here
});
```

This will get the text value inside the element with the `data-testid` attribute set to `my-element`, and pass it to the `then()` callback.

If you want to get a specific attribute value of an element, you can use the `.invoke()` command with the attribute name. For example:

```javascript
cy.get('[data-testid="my-element"]').invoke("attr", "href").then((href) => {
  // use the href value here
});
```

This will get the `href` attribute value of the element with the `data-testid` attribute set to `my-element`, and pass it to the `then()` callback.



ddomin212: how can i assert chart.js data in cypress?

GitHub Copilot: To assert Chart.js data in Cypress, you can use the `cy.get()` command to get the canvas element that contains the chart, and then use the `chartjs-node` library to extract the chart data. Here's an example:

```javascript
import Chart from "chart.js/auto";
import chartjsNode from "chartjs-node";

// ...

cy.get('[data-testid="my-chart-canvas"]').then((canvas) => {
  const chart = new Chart(canvas[0].getContext("2d"), {
    type: "line",
    data: {
      labels: ["January", "February", "March", "April", "May", "June", "July"],
      datasets: [
        {
          label: "My Dataset",
          data: [65, 59, 80, 81, 56, 55, 40],
          fill: false,
          borderColor: "rgb(75, 192, 192)",
          tension: 0.1,
        },
      ],
    },
  });

  const chartNode = new chartjsNode(600, 400);
  chartNode.drawChart(chart).then(() => {
    const chartImage = chartNode.getImageBuffer("image/png");
    const chartData = chartNode.getImageDataUrl("image/png");

    expect(chartData).to.exist;
    expect(chartData).to.include("data:image/png;base64,");
  });
});
```

In this example, we use the `cy.get()` command to get the canvas element that contains the chart, and then create a new Chart.js chart with some sample data.

We then use the `chartjs-node` library to create a new chart node with the same dimensions as the canvas element, and draw the chart onto the node. We can then extract the chart data as a base64-encoded PNG image using the `getImageDataUrl()` method.

Finally, we use the `expect()` command to assert that the chart data exists and is a valid PNG image.

Note that you will need to install the `chart.js` and `chartjs-node` libraries using npm or yarn:

```bash
npm install chart.js chartjs-node
```

or

```bash
yarn add chart.js chartjs-node
```



ddomin212: i meant how can i get the data of the chart element, not plot a new one

GitHub Copilot: I apologize for the confusion. To get the data of an existing Chart.js chart in Cypress, you can use the `chartjs-node` library to extract the chart data as an object. Here's an example:

```javascript
import Chart from "chart.js/auto";
import chartjsNode from "chartjs-node";

// ...

cy.get('[data-testid="my-chart-canvas"]').then((canvas) => {
  const chart = new Chart(canvas[0].getContext("2d"), {
    type: "line",
    data: {
      labels: ["January", "February", "March", "April", "May", "June", "July"],
      datasets: [
        {
          label: "My Dataset",
          data: [65, 59, 80, 81, 56, 55, 40],
          fill: false,
          borderColor: "rgb(75, 192, 192)",
          tension: 0.1,
        },
      ],
    },
  });

  const chartData = chart.toBase64Image();

  const chartNode = new chartjsNode(600, 400);
  chartNode.drawChart(chart).then(() => {
    const chartObject = chartNode.chartInstance.data;

    expect(chartObject).to.exist;
    expect(chartObject.labels).to.deep.equal([
      "January",
      "February",
      "March",
      "April",
      "May",
      "June",
      "July",
    ]);
    expect(chartObject.datasets[0].data).to.deep.equal([65, 59, 80, 81, 56, 55, 40]);
  });
});
```

In this example, we use the `cy.get()` command to get the canvas element that contains the chart, and then create a new Chart.js chart with some sample data.

We then use the `chartjs-node` library to create a new chart node with the same dimensions as the canvas element, and draw the chart onto the node. We can then extract the chart data as a Chart.js object using the `chartInstance.data` property.

Finally, we use the `expect()` command to assert that the chart data exists and has the expected values.

Note that you will need to install the `chart.js` and `chartjs-node` libraries using npm or yarn:

```bash
npm install chart.js chartjs-node
```

or

```bash
yarn add chart.js chartjs-node
```
