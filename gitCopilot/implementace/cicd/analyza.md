Gathering workspace info

Sure, here's a basic example of a GitHub Actions workflow for deploying a Python application to Heroku. This should be placed in a `.yml` file under your [`.github/workflows/`](command:_github.copilot.openRelativePath?%5B%22.github%2Fworkflows%2F%22%5D ".github/workflows/") directory:

```yml
name: Deploy to Heroku
on:
  push:
    branches:
      - main
jobs:
  deploy:
    runs-on: ubuntu-latest
    steps:
    - uses: actions/checkout@v3
    - uses: actions/setup-python@v4
      with:
        python-version: '3.10'
    - name: Install dependencies
      run: pip install -r backend/requirements.txt
    - name: Login to Heroku
      uses: akhileshns/heroku-deploy@v3.12.12 # This is the action
      with:
        heroku_api_key: ${{secrets.HEROKU_API_KEY}}
        heroku_app_name: "your-app-name" #Must be unique in Heroku
        heroku_email: "your-email@example.com"
    - name: Deploy to Heroku
      run: |
        git add -A
        git commit -m "Deploying to Heroku"
        git push heroku main
```

Please replace `"your-app-name"` with the name of your Heroku app and `"your-email@example.com"` with the email associated with your Heroku account. Also, you need to set the `HEROKU_API_KEY` in your repository secrets. This key can be obtained from your Heroku account settings.

This workflow will trigger every time you push to the `main` branch. It sets up Python, installs your dependencies, logs into Heroku, and deploys your application.

@workspace could you also give me a github action for deploying the frontend on firebase hosting?

Sure, here's a basic example of a GitHub Actions workflow for deploying a frontend application to Firebase Hosting. This should be placed in a `.yml` file under your [`.github/workflows/`](command:_github.copilot.openRelativePath?%5B%22.github%2Fworkflows%2F%22%5D ".github/workflows/") directory:

```yml
name: Deploy to Firebase
on:
  push:
    branches:
      - main
jobs:
  deploy:
    runs-on: ubuntu-latest
    steps:
    - uses: actions/checkout@v3
    - uses: actions/setup-node@v4
      with:
        node-version: '16'
    - name: Install dependencies
      run: npm install --prefix frontend
    - name: Build
      run: npm run build --prefix frontend
    - name: Deploy to Firebase
      uses: w9jds/firebase-action@v2
      with:
        args: deploy --only hosting
      env:
        FIREBASE_TOKEN: ${{ secrets.FIREBASE_TOKEN }}
```

Please replace `FIREBASE_TOKEN` with your Firebase token in your repository secrets. This token can be obtained by running `firebase login:ci` in your local terminal.

This workflow will trigger every time you push to the `main` branch. It sets up Node.js, installs your dependencies, builds your application, and deploys your application to Firebase Hosting.
