could you give me a github actions YAML that automatically does pytest?

GitHub Copilot: 
---
Certainly! Here's an example YAML file that runs pytest on push and pull request events:

```yaml
name: pytest

on:
  push:
    branches: [ main ]
  pull_request:
    branches: [ main ]

jobs:
  test:
    runs-on: ubuntu-latest

    steps:
    - uses: actions/checkout@v2
    - name: Set up Python
      uses: actions/setup-python@v2
      with:
        python-version: '3.9'
    - name: Install dependencies
      run: |
        python -m pip install --upgrade pip
        pip install -r requirements.txt
    - name: Run pytest
      run: |
        pytest
```

This YAML file assumes that your code is in the `main` branch and that your dependencies are listed in a `requirements.txt` file. You may need to adjust the `python-version` and `requirements.txt` file name to match your project.

what if i have enviroment variables that need to be filled in

GitHub Copilot: 
---
If you have environment variables that need to be filled in, you can use the `env` key to set them in your YAML file. Here's an example:

```yaml
name: pytest

on:
  push:
    branches: [ main ]
  pull_request:
    branches: [ main ]

env:
  MY_ENV_VAR: ${{ secrets.MY_SECRET }}

jobs:
  test:
    runs-on: ubuntu-latest

    steps:
    - uses: actions/checkout@v2
    - name: Set up Python
      uses: actions/setup-python@v2
      with:
        python-version: '3.9'
    - name: Install dependencies
      run: |
        python -m pip install --upgrade pip
        pip install -r requirements.txt
    - name: Run pytest
      env:
        MY_ENV_VAR: ${{ env.MY_ENV_VAR }}
      run: |
        pytest
```

In this example, we're setting an environment variable called `MY_ENV_VAR` using a secret called `MY_SECRET`. You can replace `MY_SECRET` with the name of your secret. Then, in the `Run pytest` step, we're using the `env` key to pass the environment variable to the pytest command. You can replace `MY_ENV_VAR` with the name of your environment variable.

where can i set this env variable in github actions?

GitHub Copilot: 
---
You can set environment variables in GitHub Actions using the `env` key in your workflow file. Here's an example of how to set an environment variable:

```yaml
name: pytest

on:
  push:
    branches: [ main ]
  pull_request:
    branches: [ main ]

env:
  MY_ENV_VAR: my_value

jobs:
  test:
    runs-on: ubuntu-latest

    steps:
    - uses: actions/checkout@v2
    - name: Set up Python
      uses: actions/setup-python@v2
      with:
        python-version: '3.9'
    - name: Install dependencies
      run: |
        python -m pip install --upgrade pip
        pip install -r requirements.txt
    - name: Run pytest
      env:
        MY_ENV_VAR: ${{ env.MY_ENV_VAR }}
      run: |
        pytest
```

In this example, we're setting an environment variable called `MY_ENV_VAR` to the value `my_value`. You can replace `my_value` with the value you want to use. Then, in the `Run pytest` step, we're using the `env` key to pass the environment variable to the pytest command. You can access the value of the environment variable using `${{ env.MY_ENV_VAR }}`.

should I add my variables to repository secrets or create a new enviroment for the secrets in Github Actions?

GitHub Copilot: 
---
It's generally recommended to use repository secrets to store sensitive information like API keys, passwords, and other secrets. This is because repository secrets are encrypted and only accessible to authorized users and workflows.

You can add your environment variables to repository secrets by going to your repository's settings, selecting "Secrets" from the left-hand menu, and then clicking "New repository secret". You can then enter the name and value of your secret.

Once you've added your secret to the repository, you can use it in your GitHub Actions workflow by referencing it using the `${{ secrets.SECRET_NAME }}` syntax. For example:

```yaml
name: pytest

on:
  push:
    branches: [ main ]
  pull_request:
    branches: [ main ]

env:
  MY_SECRET: ${{ secrets.MY_SECRET }}

jobs:
  test:
    runs-on: ubuntu-latest

    steps:
    - uses: actions/checkout@v2
    - name: Set up Python
      uses: actions/setup-python@v2
      with:
        python-version: '3.9'
    - name: Install dependencies
      run: |
        python -m pip install --upgrade pip
        pip install -r requirements.txt
    - name: Run pytest
      env:
        MY_SECRET: ${{ env.MY_SECRET }}
      run: |
        pytest
```

In this example, we're setting an environment variable called `MY_SECRET` using a repository secret called `MY_SECRET`. You can replace `MY_SECRET` with the name of your secret. Then, in the `Run pytest` step, we're using the `env` key to pass the environment variable to the pytest command. You can replace `MY_SECRET` with the name of your environment variable.

could you give me a YAML for testing a react application on GitHub Actions

GitHub Copilot: 
---
Certainly! Here's an example YAML file that runs tests for a React application using Jest on push and pull request events:

```yaml
name: Jest

on:
  push:
    branches: [ main ]
  pull_request:
    branches: [ main ]

jobs:
  test:
    runs-on: ubuntu-latest

    steps:
    - uses: actions/checkout@v2
    - name: Install Node.js
      uses: actions/setup-node@v2
      with:
        node-version: '14.x'
    - name: Install dependencies
      run: npm install
    - name: Run tests
      run: npm test
```

This YAML file assumes that your code is in the `main` branch and that your tests are run using the `npm test` command. You may need to adjust the `node-version` to match your project. If you're using a different testing framework, you'll need to adjust the `Run tests` step to use the appropriate command.

install dependencies including dev dependencies

GitHub Copilot: 
---
To install both regular and dev dependencies, you can add the `--dev` flag to the `npm install` command. Here's an updated version of the YAML file that installs both regular and dev dependencies:

```yaml
name: Jest

on:
  push:
    branches: [ frontend ]
  pull_request:
    branches: [ frontend ]

jobs:
  test:
    runs-on: ubuntu-latest

    steps:
    - uses: actions/checkout@v3
    - name: Install Node.js
      uses: actions/setup-node@v3
      with:
        node-version: '18.8.x'
    - name: Install dependencies
      run: npm install --dev
    - name: Run tests
      run: npm test
```

In this example, we're using the `--dev` flag to install both regular and dev dependencies. You can replace `frontend` with the name of your branch.

how can i run my cypress tests with github actions?

GitHub Copilot: 
---
To run Cypress tests with GitHub Actions, you can use the `cypress/run` action. Here's an example YAML file that runs Cypress tests on push and pull request events:

```yaml
name: Cypress

on:
  push:
    branches: [ main ]
  pull_request:
    branches: [ main ]

jobs:
  test:
    runs-on: ubuntu-latest

    steps:
    - uses: actions/checkout@v2
    - name: Install Node.js
      uses: actions/setup-node@v2
      with:
        node-version: '14.x'
    - name: Install dependencies
      run: npm install
    - name: Run Cypress tests
      uses: cypress-io/github-action@v2
      with:
        record: true
        start: npm start
        wait-on: 'http://localhost:3000'
        spec: 'cypress/integration/**/*.spec.js'
      env:
        CYPRESS_RECORD_KEY: ${{ secrets.CYPRESS_RECORD_KEY }}
```

In this example, we're using the `cypress-io/github-action` action to run Cypress tests. The `record` option is set to `true` to record the test results in the Cypress Dashboard. The `start` option is set to `npm start` to start the application before running the tests. The `wait-on` option is set to `http://localhost:3000` to wait for the application to start. The `spec` option is set to `cypress/integration/**/*.spec.js` to run all tests in the `cypress/integration` directory.

You'll also need to set the `CYPRESS_RECORD_KEY` environment variable to your Cypress Dashboard record key. You can add this variable to your repository secrets and reference it using `${{ secrets.CYPRESS_RECORD_KEY }}`.

but i need to run my backend in order for the tests to work or?

GitHub Copilot: 
---
Yes, that's correct. If your tests require a backend to be running, you'll need to start the backend before running the tests. You can do this by adding a step to your workflow that starts the backend server.

Here's an updated version of the YAML file that starts the backend server before running the tests:

```yaml
name: Jest

on:
  push:
    branches: [ frontend ]
  pull_request:
    branches: [ frontend ]

jobs:
  test:
    runs-on: ubuntu-latest

    steps:
    - uses: actions/checkout@v3
    - name: Install Node.js
      uses: actions/setup-node@v3
      with:
        node-version: '18.8.x'
    - name: Install dependencies
      run: npm install --dev
    - name: Start backend server
      run: npm run start:backend
      background: true
    - name: Wait for backend server to start
      run: |
        while ! nc -z localhost 3000; do sleep 1; done
    - name: Run tests
      run: npm test
      env:
        REACT_APP_SECRET_HOST_HEADER: ${{ secrets.SECRET_HOST_HEADER }}
        REACT_APP_FIREBASE_CONFIG: ${{ secrets.FIREBASE_CONFIG }}
```

In this example, we're adding two new steps to the workflow. The `Start backend server` step runs the `npm run start:backend` command to start the backend server. The `Wait for backend server to start` step waits for the backend server to start by checking if port 3000 is open using the `nc` command.

You'll need to replace `npm run start:backend` with the command that starts your backend server. You may also need to adjust the port number in the `Wait for backend server to start` step to match the port used by your backend server.

Daniel Dominko:

can i run the backend inside the github action?


GitHub Copilot: 
---
Yes, you can run the backend inside the GitHub Actions workflow. Here's an updated version of the YAML file that runs both the frontend and backend:

```yaml
name: Jest

on:
  push:
    branches: [ main ]
  pull_request:
    branches: [ main ]

jobs:
  test:
    runs-on: ubuntu-latest

    steps:
    - uses: actions/checkout@v2
    - name: Install Node.js
      uses: actions/setup-node@v2
      with:
        node-version: '14.x'
    - name: Install dependencies
      run: npm install
    - name: Start backend
      run: npm run start:backend &
      background: true
    - name: Wait for backend to start
      run: |
        while ! nc -z localhost 3000; do sleep 1; done
    - name: Start frontend
      run: npm start &
      background: true
    - name: Wait for frontend to start
      run: |
        while ! nc -z localhost 3001; do sleep 1; done
    - name: Run tests
      run: npm test
      env:
        REACT_APP_SECRET_HOST_HEADER: ${{ secrets.SECRET_HOST_HEADER }}
        REACT_APP_FIREBASE_CONFIG: ${{ secrets.FIREBASE_CONFIG }}
```

In this example, we're adding two new steps to the workflow. The `Start backend` step runs the `npm run start:backend` command to start the backend server. The `Wait for backend to start` step waits for the backend server to start by checking if port 3000 is open using the `nc` command. The `Start frontend` step runs the `npm start` command to start the frontend server. The `Wait for frontend to start` step waits for the frontend server to start by checking if port 3001 is open using the `nc` command.

You'll need to replace `npm run start:backend` with the command that starts your backend server, and replace `npm start` with the command that starts your frontend server. You may also need to adjust the port numbers in the `Wait for backend to start` and `Wait for frontend to start` steps to match the ports used by your servers.

what if my backend and frontend are located inside different branches?

GitHub Copilot: 
---
If your frontend and backend are located in different branches, you can modify the `on` section of the YAML file to specify the branches for each component. Here's an example YAML file that runs tests for a React frontend and a Node.js backend located in different branches:

```yaml
name: Jest

on:
  push:
    branches:
      - frontend
      - backend
  pull_request:
    branches:
      - frontend
      - backend

jobs:
  test:
    runs-on: ubuntu-latest

    steps:
    - uses: actions/checkout@v2
    - name: Install Node.js
      uses: actions/setup-node@v2
      with:
        node-version: '14.x'
    - name: Install dependencies
      run: npm install
    - name: Run tests
      run: npm test
      env:
        REACT_APP_SECRET_HOST_HEADER: ${{ secrets.SECRET_HOST_HEADER }}
        REACT_APP_FIREBASE_CONFIG: ${{ secrets.FIREBASE_CONFIG }}
```

In this example, we're using the `on` section to specify that the workflow should run on push and pull request events for the `frontend` and `backend` branches. You can replace `frontend` and `backend` with the names of your branches.

Note that if your frontend and backend are located in different repositories, you'll need to create separate workflows for each repository.

but i need to run my end to end using both branches at once

GitHub Copilot: 
---
If you need to run end-to-end tests that require both the frontend and backend to be running, you can modify the workflow to check out both branches and start both servers. Here's an example YAML file that checks out both the `frontend` and `backend` branches and starts both servers before running the tests:

```yaml
name: End-to-end tests

on:
  push:
    branches:
      - e2e
  pull_request:
    branches:
      - e2e

jobs:
  test:
    runs-on: ubuntu-latest

    steps:
    - uses: actions/checkout@v2
      with:
        ref: 'refs/heads/frontend'
        path: 'frontend'
    - uses: actions/checkout@v2
      with:
        ref: 'refs/heads/backend'
        path: 'backend'
    - name: Install Node.js
      uses: actions/setup-node@v2
      with:
        node-version: '14.x'
    - name: Install frontend dependencies
      working-directory: frontend
      run: npm install
    - name: Install backend dependencies
      working-directory: backend
      run: npm install
    - name: Start backend
      working-directory: backend
      run: npm run start &
      background: true
    - name: Wait for backend to start
      working-directory: backend
      run: |
        while ! nc -z localhost 3000; do sleep 1; done
    - name: Start frontend
      working-directory: frontend
      run: npm start &
      background: true
    - name: Wait for frontend to start
      working-directory: frontend
      run: |
        while ! nc -z localhost 3001; do sleep 1; done
    - name: Run tests
      working-directory: frontend
      run: npm run test:e2e
      env:
        REACT_APP_SECRET_HOST_HEADER: ${{ secrets.SECRET_HOST_HEADER }}
        REACT_APP_FIREBASE_CONFIG: ${{ secrets.FIREBASE_CONFIG }}
```

In this example, we're using the `actions/checkout` action to check out both the `frontend` and `backend` branches. We're also using the `working-directory` option to specify the working directory for each step.

The `Start backend` step starts the backend server using the `npm run start` command. The `Wait for backend to start` step waits for the backend server to start by checking if port 3000 is open using the `nc` command.

The `Start frontend` step starts the frontend server using the `npm start` command. The `Wait for frontend to start` step waits for the frontend server to start by checking if port 3001 is open using the `nc` command.

The `Run tests` step runs the end-to-end tests using the `npm run test:e2e` command. You'll need to replace `npm run test:e2e` with the command that runs your end-to-end tests.

my backend is running fastapi on python, could you modify the code accordingly?

GitHub Copilot: 
---
Sure, here's an updated version of the YAML file that runs both the React frontend and FastAPI backend:

```yaml
name: End-to-end tests

on:
  push:
    branches:
      - e2e
  pull_request:
    branches:
      - e2e

jobs:
  test:
    runs-on: ubuntu-latest

    steps:
    - uses: actions/checkout@v2
      with:
        ref: 'refs/heads/frontend'
        path: 'frontend'
    - uses: actions/checkout@v2
      with:
        ref: 'refs/heads/backend'
        path: 'backend'
    - name: Install Node.js
      uses: actions/setup-node@v2
      with:
        node-version: '14.x'
    - name: Install frontend dependencies
      working-directory: frontend
      run: npm install
    - name: Install backend dependencies
      working-directory: backend
      run: |
        python -m venv env
        source env/bin/activate
        pip install -r requirements.txt
    - name: Start backend
      working-directory: backend
      run: uvicorn main:app --reload &
      background: true
    - name: Wait for backend to start
      working-directory: backend
      run: |
        while ! nc -z localhost 8000; do sleep 1; done
    - name: Start frontend
      working-directory: frontend
      run: npm start &
      background: true
    - name: Wait for frontend to start
      working-directory: frontend
      run: |
        while ! nc -z localhost 3000; do sleep 1; done
    - name: Run tests
      working-directory: frontend
      run: npm run test:e2e
      env:
        REACT_APP_API_URL: 'http://localhost:8000'
```

In this example, we're using the `actions/checkout` action to check out both the `frontend` and `backend` branches. We're also using the `working-directory` option to specify the working directory for each step.

The `Install backend dependencies` step creates a Python virtual environment and installs the dependencies from the `requirements.txt` file.

The `Start backend` step starts the FastAPI server using the `uvicorn` command. The `Wait for backend to start` step waits for the backend server to start by checking if port 8000 is open using the `nc` command.

The `Start frontend` step starts the React server using the `npm start` command. The `Wait for frontend to start` step waits for the frontend server to start by checking if port 3000 is open using the `nc` command.

The `Run tests` step runs the end-to-end tests using the `npm run test:e2e` command. You'll need to replace `npm run test:e2e` with the command that runs your end-to-end tests. The `REACT_APP_API_URL` environment variable is set to `http://localhost:8000` to specify the URL of the backend server.
