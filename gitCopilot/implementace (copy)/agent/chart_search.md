The chart component is located in the file [`frontend/src/components/ChartView.jsx`](command:_github.copilot.openRelativePath?%5B%22frontend%2Fsrc%2Fcomponents%2FChartView.jsx%22%5D "frontend/src/components/ChartView.jsx").

ddomin212: @workspace could you add a bar chart to the frontend/src/components/ChartView.jsx component?

Sure, you can add a Bar chart to your [`ChartView.jsx`](command:_github.copilot.openRelativePath?%5B%22frontend%2Fsrc%2Fcomponents%2FChartView.jsx%22%5D "frontend/src/components/ChartView.jsx") component by using the `Bar` component from the `react-chartjs-2` library. Here's an example of how you can do it:

```javascriptreact
import { Bar } from 'react-chartjs-2';

// ...

return (
  yearly && (
    <div className="mt-10 items-center justify-center" data-testid="chart-view">
      {/* ... */}
      <div className="mt-2">
        <Bar
          data-testid="chart-js"
          data={createChartData(xValues, yValues, selectedOption)}
          options={chartOptions}
        />
      </div>
    </div>
  )
);
```

This will replace the Line chart with a Bar chart. If you want to keep both, you can add a new state variable to switch between the two chart types based on user input. 

Please note that you need to have the `react-chartjs-2` and `chart.js` libraries installed in your project. If not, you can add them by running:

```sh
npm install --save react-chartjs-2 chart.js
```

Remember to adjust the `createChartData` and `chartOptions` to fit the Bar chart's data and options structure.

ddomin212: @workspace Give me a React component that shows the prediction for multiple days inside a bar chart

I'm sorry, but based on the information provided about your workspace, there doesn't seem to be a specific React component that displays a prediction for multiple days inside a bar chart. 

However, you can create a new component using the `react-chartjs-2` library, which seems to be used in your project (as seen in the [`ChartView.jsx`](command:_github.copilot.openRelativePath?%5B%22frontend%2Fsrc%2Fcomponents%2FChartView.jsx%22%5D "frontend/src/components/ChartView.jsx") file). Here's a basic example of how you might create a bar chart component:

```javascript
import { Bar } from 'react-chartjs-2';

function MultiDayPredictionChart({ data, options }) {
  return (
    <div>
      <Bar data={data} options={options} />
    </div>
  );
}

export default MultiDayPredictionChart;
```

In this example, `data` would be an object containing the labels (the days) and the datasets (the predictions), and `options` would be an object containing any additional options for the chart. You would need to pass these as props when using the `MultiDayPredictionChart` component.

Please note that you would need to install the `react-chartjs-2` and `chart.js` libraries if they are not already installed in your project. You can do this by running `npm install --save react-chartjs-2 chart.js` in your terminal.
