ddomin212: Could you give me any refactoring tips the AirQuality component, in terms of code performance, clean code (DRY, SOLID, KISS...), code standards (ES), readability, accessibility, web responsivness and testability? If you have idea for any different metrics that could be mentioned, mention them along with the improvments.

GitHub Copilot: Sure, here are some suggestions for refactoring the `AirQuality` component:

- **Performance**: The `formatToLocalTime` function is called every time the component is rendered, even if the `timestamp` prop hasn't changed. You could memoize this function using the `useMemo` hook to avoid unnecessary re-renders. Additionally, you could consider using the `React.memo` higher-order component to memoize the entire `AirQuality` component and avoid re-rendering it when its props haven't changed.

- **Clean code**: The `airQuality[time]` array is accessed twice in the component, which violates the DRY principle. You could extract this array into a variable to avoid duplicating the code. Additionally, you could consider using the `Array.prototype.map` method to transform the `airQuality[time]` array into an array of JSX elements, instead of using a `for` loop.

- **Code standards**: The component uses ES6 syntax, which is a good practice. However, the `AIR_QUALITY_METRICS` constant is defined outside of the component, which violates the encapsulation principle. You could define this constant inside the component or pass it as a prop to avoid coupling the component to an external module.

- **Readability**: The component uses CSS classes to style its elements, which is a good practice. However, the class names are not very descriptive and could be improved. You could consider using BEM or another naming convention to make the class names more meaningful.

- **Accessibility**: The component uses semantic HTML elements (`<div>`, `<p>`, `<hr>`) and has a `data-testid` attribute, which is a good practice. However, the component doesn't have any ARIA attributes to improve its accessibility. You could consider adding ARIA attributes to make the component more accessible to users with disabilities.

- **Web responsiveness**: The component doesn't have any media queries or responsive design, which could make it difficult to use on smaller screens. You could consider adding media queries or responsive design to make the component more usable on different devices.

- **Testability**: The component doesn't have any unit tests, which could make it difficult to maintain and refactor. You could consider writing unit tests for the component using a testing library like Jest or React Testing Library.

I hope these suggestions help you improve the `AirQuality` component!
