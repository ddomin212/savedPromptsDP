USER
I want to create a simple weather dashboard web application, which fetches data from a weather API, parses them on the backend and then sends them to the frontend and also saves them inside a database. The main parameter should be that the app is free to create, as I don't have any money to spend. 
	
	Which "tech stack" would you recommend for this, in regards to:
	1. the programming lanaguage and framework for the backend
	2. the programming lanaguage and framework for the frontend
	3. weather API to get information from
	4. database, SQL and NoSQL
	5. Containerization service
	6. Cloud service to deploy to
	7. Version control system
	8. Package manager
	9. Configuration manager
	10. Logging and monitoring service
	11. Testing, which includes unit, integration and end2end testing
	Give me your recommendations along with 3 other alternatives and a specific reason to why you chose this specific one, and why you did not choose the alternatives. The areas you should consider in your tech stack are:
	1. scalibility
	2. availability
	3. price
	4. performance
	5. security
	6. scalability
	7. clean code and readability of code
	8. community support
	along with many others that are for you to infer. Also give me a list of other libraries (except the ones for frameworks, dependency managment etc.) that I should use in my program. Prefer long-standing libraries since they are more likely to get support long-term.

Now with your chosen tech stack, we will move towards desiging the application itself. I want you to give me recommendations on the following problems that I am facing while writing this app:
	1. Should I use functional or object oriented desing, or both?
	2. Should I use REST, GraphQL or something else for communication between components?
	3. Should I use a raw table and a clean table inside my database? Would SQL or NoSQL be a better fit?
	4. How would you go about backing up and archiving the weather data inside the database?
	5. How would you handle the security aspect of the app, in regards to CORS or XSS etc.? Also how would you handle input validation? Would you recommend any libraries?
	6. How would you structure the app in terms of files, modules and objects (that is if we use the OOP approach), so I don't mess up my code right from the get go
	7. Which desing patterns should I use inside my code (factory, proxy etc.)?
	8. How would you handle the routing of the app? Is it worth it to implement state managment tools if the app is quite simple?
	9. Would you recommend caching the data for such an app, or using lazy loading?
	
BING

Here are my recommendations for the problems you are facing:

1. **Functional or Object-Oriented Design**: Both functional and object-oriented design patterns have their own advantages and disadvantages. It is recommended to use a combination of both to achieve the best results. You can use functional programming for simple tasks and object-oriented programming for more complex tasks.

2. **Communication between components**: REST is a good choice for communication between components as it is simple and widely used. GraphQL is also a good choice if you need more flexibility in your API.

3. **Database**: SQL databases are generally better suited for structured data, while NoSQL databases are better suited for unstructured data. You can use a raw table to store the data as it is received from the API, and a clean table to store the processed data.

4. **Backing up and archiving data**: You can use a backup service such as Amazon S3 to store backups of your database. You can also use a service like AWS Glacier for long-term archiving.

5. **Security**: To handle security issues such as CORS and XSS, you can use a web application firewall (WAF) such as AWS WAF or Cloudflare WAF. For input validation, you can use a library such as Joi or Express Validator.

6. **Structuring the app**: You can structure your app using the Model-View-Controller (MVC) pattern. This will help you keep your code organized and maintainable.

7. **Design patterns**: You can use design patterns such as Factory, Proxy, and Observer to improve the structure of your code.

8. **Routing**: You can use a routing library such as Express.js to handle routing in your app. If your app is simple, you may not need to implement state management tools.

9. **Caching**: Caching can help improve the performance of your app by reducing the number of requests made to the API. You can use a caching library such as Redis or Memcached to cache the data.

In number 3, you don't really recommend anything, but I want a specific recommendation for the app I am building. In number 5 you just reiterated what I said, but I wanted for you to list more concerns I terms of security and how to handle them.

BING

For your weather dashboard web application, I would recommend using a **SQL database**. SQL databases are well-suited for structured data, which is what you will be working with in this case. They also provide strong data consistency and integrity, which is important for a weather dashboard application ¹⁶⁷.

In terms of security, you should consider using a web application firewall (WAF) such as AWS WAF or Cloudflare WAF to handle security issues such as CORS and XSS. You should also use input validation libraries such as Joi or Express Validator to validate user input and prevent attacks such as SQL injection ⁵. Other security concerns you should consider include:
- Authentication and authorization
- Encryption of sensitive data
- Protection against DDoS attacks
- Regular security audits

In terms of file structure, you can use the Model-View-Controller (MVC) pattern to organize your code. This will help you keep your code organized and maintainable. You can also use design patterns such as Factory, Proxy, and Observer to improve the structure of your code ⁸.

For routing, you can use a routing library such as Express.js to handle routing in your app. If your app is simple, you may not need to implement state management tools.

Caching can help improve the performance of your app by reducing the number of requests made to the API. You can use a caching library such as Redis or Memcached to cache the data ⁹.

Here are some additional libraries you might find useful:
- Axios: A promise-based HTTP client for making API requests.
- Moment.js: A library for parsing, validating, manipulating, and formatting dates.
- Chart.js: A library for creating charts and graphs.
- Lodash: A utility library that provides many useful functions for working with arrays, objects, strings, etc.

Please note that these are just recommendations based on the criteria you provided. You should choose the tools that best suit your needs and requirements ¹²³⁴⁵⁶⁷⁸⁹.

USER
In "6. App Structure" I wanted you to give me an approximation of how the project folder could look like. In "7. Design Patterns" I wanted you to list the specific design patterns that could be used inside my app, not the general patterns used

BING

I apologize for the confusion. Here are my recommendations:

6. **App Structure**: Here is an example of how your project folder could be structured:
```
weather-app/
├── backend/
│   ├── app.py
│   ├── requirements.txt
│   ├── models.py
│   ├── controllers.py
│   └── utils.py
├── frontend/
│   ├── public/
│   │   ├── index.html
│   │   └── favicon.ico
│   ├── src/
│   │   ├── App.js
│   │   ├── index.js
│   │   └── components/
│   │       ├── Header.js
│   │       ├── WeatherCard.js
│   │       └── ...
│   └── package.json
├── database/
│   └── weather.db
├── docker-compose.yml
├── Dockerfile.backend
├── Dockerfile.frontend
└── README.md
```
This structure separates the backend, frontend, and database into their own directories. The `docker-compose.yml` file is used to define the services that make up your app, and the `Dockerfile` files are used to build the Docker images for each service.

7. **Design Patterns**: Here are some specific design patterns that could be used in your app:
- **Model-View-Controller (MVC)**: This pattern separates the application into three interconnected components: the model (data), the view (user interface), and the controller (handles user input). This pattern can help you keep your code organized and maintainable.
- **Factory**: This pattern provides an interface for creating objects in a superclass, but allows subclasses to alter the type of objects that will be created. This can help you create objects more easily and with less code.
- **Observer**: This pattern defines a one-to-many relationship between objects, so that when one object changes state, all of its dependents are notified and updated automatically. This can help you keep your code decoupled and modular.

Here are some additional libraries you might find useful:
- **React Router**: A library for handling routing in React apps.
- **Redux**: A library for managing state in React apps.
- **Jest**: A testing library for JavaScript.
- **Enzyme**: A testing utility for React.

Please note that these are just recommendations based on the criteria you provided. You should choose the tools and patterns that best suit your needs and requirements ¹²³⁴⁵⁶⁷⁸⁹.

Here are some brief descriptions of the classes:
- **WeatherAPI**: This class is responsible for fetching weather data from an API.
- **Database**: This class is responsible for storing and retrieving data from a database.
- **User**: This class represents a user of the application and contains information such as their name and email address.
- **Dashboard**: This class is responsible for rendering the weather data on the frontend.

Please note that this is just one example of how your classes could be structured. You should choose the classes that best suit your needs and requirements ¹²³⁴⁵⁶⁷⁸⁹.
